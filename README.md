# Face-Recognition
## Introduction 
Face Recognition using Siamese Neural Network - Mathematical Models For Technology, Economy and Medicine
In this project we build a mathematical model of a Siamese Neural Network(SNN) in order to tackle the problem of Face Recognition in Machine Learning. We implement the mathematical in python via Jupyter Notebook and train the SNN in order to attempt to  achieve optimal results. 
## Dataset
In order to train the SNN in an optimal matter we used the Digiface  Microsoft dataset which is a dataset filled with digital images of humans from different angles. We use the version where each digital human is assigned 5 pictures from different angles. Using this dataset we train the SNN and achieve results.

## Course
The course which the project was done in is Mathematical Models in Technology, Economoy and Medicine  in the Mathematics Department in Ariel University.
The course was assigned 10 weekly meetings where each meeting was about a different mathematical model e.g.,  Linear Regression , Convolutional Neural Networks , Functional  Differential Equations.
